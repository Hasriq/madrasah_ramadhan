					<p>
					Ramadhan is one of the month in Islamic calender. The word Ramadhan derives from the Arabic root (ر-م-ض‎) which give the meaning 
					of "scorching heat". During Ramadhan every sane, healthy Muslim whose reached puberty and is not traveling during the time are obligated to fast
					for the whole month. There are some exceptional for certain people where they are not compulsory to fast. This exceptional applied to people who
					have permanent illness or due to old age which make them unable to fast and pregnant and nursing women, who are afraid that fasting may weaken them 
					or the child. For those who cannot fast due to a permanent illness or old age, they have to pay fidiya (feeding one poor person) for each day 
					that they have missed. However, women who are experiencing post-childbirth bleeding or are in their menses are not allowed to fast until their bleeding ends. 
					The Muslim start fasting from the dawn until dusk and during the period, drinking, eating and anything that can nullify the fasting are prohibited.
					Other matter that can lead to the nullification of fast are smoking, intentional vomiting and intentional sexual intercourse.

					<h4>What is Tarawih</h4>
					<p>
					During Ramadhan, there is a special prayer that being perform after Isyak prayer which is called Tarawih. It is considered as special because Muslim only able to perform Tarawih during Ramadhan and not other months.
					Tarawih is not obligatory but highly recommended to be perform because of its limitation of time to perform. There are differents opinion on how many rakaat Tarawih should be done. Some scholars said 8, 20 and even 36.
					Commonly people do 8 and 20 rakaat.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					Our beloved Prophet says: “Whoever performs the tarawih prayer by believing in the virtue of Ramadan and asks for the divine rewards earned only from Allah, his prior sins are erased.” (Bukhari, Iman 37)
					</p>
					<br>

					<br>
					<h4>What is Zakat Fitrah</h4>
					<p>
					Zakat – also known as zakah – is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and serves principally as the welfare contribution to poor and deprived individuals. The payment of zakat is obligatory for every sane and mature Muslim whenever there is an economic activity resulting in the net increase in their wealth.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					Zakat not only purifies the property of the contributor but also purifies his heart from selfishness and greed. It also purifies the heart of the recipient from envy and jealousy, from hatred and uneasiness and it fosters instead goodwill and warm wishes for the contributors.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					Zakat Al-Fitr has to be given by the head of the family before the start of the Eid-prayer, to the poor and less privileged. This is to ensure that all Muslims celebrate a hunger free Eid filled with happiness and contentment. The local food or wheat is generally used as a measure in giving Zakat Al-Fitr.
